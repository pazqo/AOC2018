    "Well, this one was the first challenge, at least in the second part. It's a graph-ordering problem. We can model every sentence `Step x must be finished before step y can begin` implies that there's a DAG with nodes `x` and `y` and with a directed path from `x` to `y`. We need to collect all information and build corresponding graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, we want to explore the graph. A node is available when all preceeding nodes are completed. Hence, we start with nodes that are immediatly available, then we upgrade the explored nodes list. If two steps are available, choose the first one alphabetically (i.e. I need to re-compute the list of available steps after every node completed)."

    "Now for the real challenge! The second part is much tougher. We need to parallelize the job to many workers (5); moreover, every node has it's own timing, i.e., `60 + ordinal number of char`. So for example, step `A` will take `60+1` seconds, `B` will take `60+2`, ..., `Z` will take `60+26`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, a step cannot start if every previous step is not completed, which means that we need to care of the fact that a node have to be visited and a certain amount of time should have passed. When no worker is available or no node is available, we need to wait for a node to be completed (of course, time will pass for other workers too). This will free a worker (for sure) and maybe give access to more nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of using a class for workers, I use a pair `(n, C)` where `n` is the remaining time and `C` is the current task; so after waiting `n` minutes, task `C` is completed and worker is ready for next task.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a little trick: we add one extra node (`*`) as a target for every \"final\" node. This will make it easier to write the logic."
