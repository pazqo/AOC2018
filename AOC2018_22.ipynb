    "The most tricky part of this challenge was to search a path in a multi-state labyrinth. I found a solution which was not optimal, but fast enough to finish in minutes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main idea is to create a cave large enough to contain the whole explorative area. Then, a modified Dijkstra will keep track of both the position and the tool. If I reach a previous point, with the same tool but in less time, I start exploring again. Some time could be saved by memoizing all possible paths, but this kind of optimization was not necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "I don't have a perfect solution, meaning that I don't have a stopping condition. I just run the algorithm for enough time that no further optimizations are found for a long time (1200 steps are just enough!)"
